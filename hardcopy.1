    in this case.

    If the arguments don't match any tables then you'll still get a statement ha
ndle, it'll just return no rows.

    The statement handle returned has at least the following fields in the order
 shown below. Other fields, after these, may
    also be present.

    TABLE_CAT: The catalog identifier. This field is NULL ("undef") if not appli
cable to the data source, which is often the
    case. This field is empty if not applicable to the table.

    TABLE_SCHEM: The schema identifier. This field is NULL ("undef") if not appl
icable to the data source, and empty if not
    applicable to the table.

    TABLE_NAME: The table identifier. Note: A driver may provide column metadata
 not only for base tables, but also for
    derived objects like SYNONYMS etc.
